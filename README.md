# JavaFX-Basic-Inventory-Manager

This was a basic project for a simple Inventory Management System, an Auto Repair shop specifically.

This project was written in Apache NetBeans and requires JavaFX to be installed to run properly.

The project runs as a desktop GUI that allows the user to add, remove and delete various car parts from the inventory.
